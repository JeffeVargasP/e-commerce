# Express RESTful API

This is a simple RESTful API built with Node.js and Express framework.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed on your local machine. You can download and install it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- npm (Node Package Manager) installed. npm is typically installed alongside Node.js.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JeffeVargasP/e-commerce.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd e-commerce
```

3. Install dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

5. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can send HTTP requests to interact with the API. The available endpoints are listed below:

- `GET /api/order`: Retrieves all orders.

- `GET /api/order/:id`: Retrieves a specific order by ID.

- `POST /api/order`: Creates a new order.

- `DELETE /api/order/:id`: Deletes an order by ID.

- `GET /api/user`: Retrieves all users.

- `GET /api/user/:id`: Retrieves a specific user by ID.

- `POST /api/user`: Creates a new user.

- `DELETE /api/user/:id`: Deletes a user by ID.

- `GET /api/product`: Retrieves all products.

- `GET /api/product/:id`: Retrieves a specific product by ID.

- `POST /api/product`: Creates a new product.

- `PATCH /api/product/:id`: Updates an existing product by ID.

- `DELETE /api/product/:id`: Deletes a product by ID.

Please note that for endpoints requiring data input, you should include the appropriate JSON payload in the request body.

## Configuration

You can configure the server port and other settings by modifying the `config.js` file (Change example.config.js to config.js).
